# macOS Screen Savers

Here is a list of all the screen savers from macOS Sonoma & macOS Sequoia.

Feel free to click through each link to watch them in browser first before downloading them in your System Settings (as they can take a large amount of storage, totaling over 50GB).

While the screen saver's preview images are stored for viewing purposes, this repository only provides links to Apple servers for viewing the full videos.
